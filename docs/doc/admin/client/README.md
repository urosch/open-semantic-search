# Client integration

## Browser integration

To spare some seconds to call the search engine bookmark to get the search interface you can easily integrate the search with the web browser search field (i.e. Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome or Opera) via the OpenSearch standard.

## Desktop integrated search

If you use Unity or Gnome as your Linux Desktop, you can integrate search results to the search lenses, so can search by pressing just a key and it will be fully integrated with your desktop instead of having to start a client or browser and call the URL.

## Filemanager

If you don't use [filesystem monitoring](../../../trigger/filemonitoring) for indexing all changes automatically, it is possible to integrate to start indexing files easily and comfortable with the context menu of your standard filemanager (i.e. Explorer in Windows or Nautilus in Debian or Ubuntu Linux).
