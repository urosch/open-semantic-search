# Development of free open source search engine software


## Free Software

Open Semantic Search is Open Source software based on Apache Lucene / Solr Enterprise Search and Python. You are allowed to read, to change and to extend the source code.

## Source code

The source code is included within the packages.

There is a [git repository on Github](https://github.com/opensemanticsearch).

## Contact the developers

Contant interested free software developers directly:

E-Mail: info Ã¤t opensemanticsearch.org

Communicate to or work on the open source software project on Github:

## Architecture

* [Software architecture: Components, services, modules and plugins](../doc/modules)

## Search or read data for additional applications

If you use Solr as your database or index, use the [Rest-API of Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/quickstart.html#searching) for searching or / and getting data in XML or [JSON](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Using+JavaScript) format or use [Solr Client APIs](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Client+APIs) to get data with your favorite programming language.

Or if you use a triple store as database use its standard SPARQL interface.

## Libraries for different programming languages

* [Libraries, bindings, and modules that exist for the explicit purpose of integrating Solr with other applications or programming languages](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/IntegratingSolr)

## Data enrichment and data analysis plugins

* [Development of own Solr plugins](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/SolrPlugins)
* [Development of own data enrichment plugins](enhancer)
* [Development of own data enrichment plugins with Python](enhancer/python)
