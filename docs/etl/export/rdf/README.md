# Export extracted and enriched data to a graph or triplestore (RDF)

## Export data, data enrichments and analysis results to a graph or triplestore

Exports data, data enrichments or data analysis results as linked data in **Resource Description Format (RDF or Turtle/NT)** or to a **triplestore (graph database)** like *Apache Jena Fuseki*, *Sesame, RDF4J or OpenRDF*.

So you can use many other tools or share the data using **open standards** for **Linked Data and the Semantic Web**.

### Mapping RDF properties to fields or facets

If you use connector and data enrichment plugins that don't work with semantic web formats, you can map legacy fields or facets to RDF properties.

The mapping is configured in a graph, for example RDF or a turtle (NT) file.
